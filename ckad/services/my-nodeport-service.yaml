  ports:
  - name: promotheus
    nodePort: 32378  # This value is generated for you when left out. It will be random between 30000 and 32768 or something. This will be the same for all nodes. Assume that k8s translates the 8080 to this random port and then translate again to the targetport?? Not sure but that's how it seems.
