# pods
A pod is a group of one or more containers (such as Docker containers), with shared storage/network, and a specification for how to run the containers.<br>
All containers within a pod share the same IP address and volumes.<br>
They can also communicate via Inter-Process Communication (such as using shared memory space).<br>

If containers exist in separate pods, they can't use the IPC communication and would have to speak to each other via the pods' separate IP addresses.

## display your pods
You can see the individual pods that make up your deployment through issuing `kubectl get pods <pod name>`
```bash
kubectl get pods     
NAME                    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
web1-74c74989b5-2kkbv   1/1     Running   2          120m
web1-74c74989b5-2vhnx   1/1     Running   2          120m
web1-74c74989b5-4l4ss   1/1     Running   2          120m
web1-74c74989b5-8p65q   1/1     Running   2          120m
web1-74c74989b5-9vp8k   1/1     Running   3          120m
web1-74c74989b5-dzqwl   1/1     Running   2          120m
web1-74c74989b5-k7htc   1/1     Running   2          120m
--- 
```
You can customise your output by using `--output=` or `-o=`.<br>
One example is `--output=wide` which gives you for example your IP address and the node of that pod.

```bash
kubectl get po -o=wide
NAME                    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE   IP           NODE       NOMINATED NODE   READINESS GATES
web1-74c74989b5-jmsvg   1/1     Running   0          49m   172.17.0.2   minikube   <none>           <none>
```

## details about your pods
You can display a great deal of details about your pods with `kubectl describe pod <pod name>`<br>
For example you can see their `namespace`, which `node` they are on, their IP etc.
```bash
kubectl describe pod web1-74c74989b5-2kkbv
Name:         web1-74c74989b5-2kkbv
Namespace:    default
Priority:     0
Node:         minikube/192.168.99.100
```

## logs from your pods
Just like in docker, you can tail the logs from a group of containers.<br>
You do this with `kubectl logs -f <name of pod>`
```bash
kubectl logs -f web1-74c74989b5-jmsvg                             

172.17.0.1 - - [16/Feb/2020:07:42:35 +0000] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 7240 "-" "Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64; rv:72.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/72.0" "-"
```

# deployments
A deployment declares the state of `pods` or `ReplicaSets`.<br>
You describe a desired state in a Deployment, and the Deployment Controller changes the actual state to the desired state at a controlled rate.<br>

## display your deployments
View your deployments with `kubectl get deployments <deployment name>` or `kubectl get deploy` for short and for all deployments.
```bash
kubectl get deploy web1                       
NAME   READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
web1   1/1     1            1           3m17s
```

You can interactively view your deployments with `kubectl get deploy --watch` or `-w` for short.<br>
This will automatically update the output.
```bash
kubectl get deploy --watch                        
NAME   READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
web1   1/1     1            1           3m50s
```

## details about your deployments
You can get a bunch of good details about your deployments with `kubectl describe deployments <deployment name>`
```bash
kubectl describe deployments web1
Name:                   web1
Namespace:              default
CreationTimestamp:      Sun, 16 Feb 2020 12:00:53 +1100
Labels:                 app=web1
Annotations:            deployment.kubernetes.io/revision: 1
Selector:               app=web1
Replicas:               20 desired | 20 updated | 20 total | 20 available | 0 unavailable
StrategyType:           RollingUpdate
```

# services
You can view your exposed services by issuing the command `kubectl get service <service name>`

## View your services
```bash
kubectl get service web1
NAME   TYPE           CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)        AGE
web1   LoadBalancer   10.102.40.76   <pending>     80:30067/TCP   131m
```

## View details of your services
With the `kubectl describe` command you get a new depth of information about your environment.<br>
With this you can see the namespace
```bash
kubectl describe service web1
Name:                     web1
Namespace:                default
Labels:                   app=web1
Annotations:              <none>
Selector:                 app=web1

```

# ReplicaSet

A ReplicaSetâ€™s purpose is to maintain a stable set of replica Pods running at any given time. As such, it is often used to guarantee the availability of a specified number of identical Pods.<br>
We used this to create 20 web servers as an example with the imperative `kubectl scale deployment --replicas 20 web1`

## view your replicasets
```bash
kubectl get replicasets          
NAME              DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE
web1-74c74989b5   20        20        20      6h24m
```

## view details about your replicasets
```bash
kubectl describe replicasets web1-74c74989b5 
Name:           web1-74c74989b5
Namespace:      default
Selector:       app=web1,pod-template-hash=74c74989b5
Labels:         app=web1
                pod-template-hash=74c74989b5
Annotations:    deployment.kubernetes.io/desired-replicas: 20
```

# namespaces
Namespaces are intended for use in environments with many users spread across multiple teams, or projects.<br>
For clusters with a few to tens of users, you should not need to create or think about namespaces at all.<br>
`default namespace` is where all your pods and services will end up unless otherwise specified.
```bash
kubectl get namespaces       
NAME              STATUS   AGE
default           Active   6h2m
kube-node-lease   Active   6h2m
kube-public       Active   6h2m
kube-system       Active   6h2m
```

To set the namespace for a current request, use the --namespace flag.
```bash
kubectl run nginx --image=nginx --namespace=<insert-namespace-name-here>
kubectl get pods --namespace=<insert-namespace-name-here>
```

You can permanently save the namespace for all subsequent kubectl commands in that context.

```bash
kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=<insert-namespace-name-here>
# Validate it
kubectl config view --minify | grep namespace:
```

# Imperative kubectl
Shout instructions at your cluster basically

### Create a deployment
```bash
# Create a deployment from a demo nginx hello world image
kubectl create deployment --image nginxdemos/hello web1
deployment.apps/web1 created
```

### Scale your deployment
You can scale your deployment by issuing `kubectl scale deployment --replicas <desired number> <deployment name>`<br>
```bash
kubectl scale deployment --replicas 20 web1            
deployment.apps/web1 scaled

# view your new 20 deployments slowly become ready
kubectl get deployments                         
NAME   READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
web1   2/20    20           2           7m48s
```

### expose a deployment to the network
Make ports available by using `kubectl expose deployment <deployment name> --port=<port> --type=<type>` <br>
Adding load onto the load balancer will cause it to distribute the load on to different pods.
```bash
# Simple LoadBalancer example on port 80
kubectl expose deployment web1 --port=80 --type=LoadBalancer
service/web1 exposed
```
There are many types of ways to expose network ports, not only a LoadBalancer.


### Minikube special to connect to your deployment's load-balancer
minikube runs in a virtual machine.<br>
That virtual machine has an internally natted address that we need to extract to be able to connect to our service.<br>
minikube that we run in this course has a command to get the load-balancer URL from your deployment and automatically start your default browser.<br>
This is done with `minikube service <service name>`
```bash
minikube service web1
|-----------|------|-------------|-----------------------------|
| NAMESPACE | NAME | TARGET PORT |             URL             |
|-----------|------|-------------|-----------------------------|
| default   | web1 |             | http://192.168.99.100:30067 |
|-----------|------|-------------|-----------------------------|
ðŸŽ‰  Opening service default/web1 in default browser...
```

# Declarative kubectl
Tell it what you want the end state to look like.<br>
Point to `manifests` (a metadata file for an accompanying collection of files or a single file).<br>
These files are either in `yaml` or in `json`.<br>
These are at runtime converted to `json` and sent to the `kubernetes api`.
```bash
kubectl deploy -f <manifest file or URL>
```
## deploy from a URL or file
Let's look at an example of deploying a wordpress blog by declaring state.
```bash
# example for deploying a redis master
kubectl apply -f https://k8s.io/examples/application/guestbook/redis-master-deployment.yaml

# confirm that your deployment was created
kubectl get deployments
NAME           READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
redis-master   1/1     1            1           13m

# Confirm that you pod was created
kubectl get pods   
NAME                            READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
redis-master-7db7f6579f-8zkq7   1/1     Running   0          13m

# tail logs from redis master
kubectl logs -f redis-master-7db7f6579f-8zkq7
```
## delete deployments
You can clean up the whole deployment with `kubectl delete deployment <deployment name>`<br>
```bash
kubectl delete deployment redis-master
deployment.apps "redis-master" deleted
```
If you want to delete multiple deployments at the same time you can point to their `label`.<br>
The label is found by using the `kubectl describe deployment <name>`

```bash
#Find the label
kubectl describe deployment redis-master
Labels:                 app=redis

# delete by label
kubectl delete deployment -l app=redis                                                     
deployment.apps "redis-master" deleted
```


# kustomize
`kustomize` started out as a standalone tool for customisation of kubernetes objects through `kustomization files`.<br>
However, since `kubectl` version 1.14, `kubectl` can utilise the `kustomization files` too! <br>

## secrets and configmaps 
Kustomize can be used to generate resources - `kubernetes secrets` and `configmaps`


Create a file for password info
```bash
cat password.txt      
username=admin
password=secret
```
Create a kustmization file for a secret
```bash
cat kustomization.yaml 
secretGenerator:
- name: example-secret-1
  files:
  - password.txt
```
View what kustomize would produce with `kubectl kustomize <kustomize dir>`
```bash
kubectl kustomize ./  
apiVersion: v1
data:
  password.txt: dXNlcm5hbWU9YWRtaW4KcGFzc3dvcmQ9c2VjcmV0Cg==
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: example-secret-1-t2kt65hgtb
type: Opaque
```
Actually execute the kustomization with `kubectl apply --kustomize <kustomize dir>` or just `-k` for short.
```bash
kubectl apply -k ./                                                                        
secret/example-secret-1-t2kt65hgtb created
```
Verify that your secret was created
```bash
kubectl get secrets        
NAME                          TYPE                                  DATA   AGE
example-secret-1-t2kt65hgtb   Opaque                                1      4m37s
```

## setting cross-cutting fields
By cross-cutting fields we mean configuration fields that span an entire `project`.<br>
Such as setting the same `label` across all resources in a `project`.<br>
Or set the same `namespace`, or `name-prefixes`.<br>
Let's have a look at an example of a normal deployment yaml file.
```bash
# base deployment file
cat deployment.yaml   
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
  labels:
    app: nginx
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx
```
We specify a kustomization file to set namespace, name prefix, suffix, label, annotation.<br>
We specify which resources that this should affect.
```bash
# kustomization file
cat kustomization.yaml      
namespace: my-namespace
namePrefix: dev-
nameSuffix: "-001"
commonLabels:
  app: bingo
commonAnnotations:
  oncallPager: 800-555-1212
resources:
- deployment.yaml
```
Let's look at the result. We issue `kubectl kustomize ./` to run `kustomize` in the pwd.
```bash
# Resulting file. Notice the name-prefix, suffix, label and annotation. 
kubectl kustomize ./
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  annotations:
    oncallPager: 800-555-1212
  labels:
    app: bingo
  name: dev-nginx-deployment-001
  namespace: my-namespace
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: bingo
  template:
    metadata:
      annotations:
        oncallPager: 800-555-1212
      labels:
        app: bingo
    spec:
      containers:
      - image: nginx
        name: nginx
```

# All api resources
If you want to see all available api resources you can get them with kubectl.<br>
Simply issue the command `kubectl api-resource` and you get a big list of resources.<br>
You can use this to find the shortnames for the resources as an example.

```bash
kubectl api-resources

```
