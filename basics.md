# pods
A pod is a group of one or more containers (such as Docker containers), with shared storage/network, and a specification for how to run the containers.<br>
All containers within a pod share the same IP address and volumes.<br>
They can also communicate via Inter-Process Communication (such as using shared memory space).<br>

If containers exist in separate pods, they can't use the IPC communication and would have to speak to each other via the pods' separate IP addresses.

## display your pods
You can see the individual pods that make up your deployment through issuing `kubectl get pods <pod name>`
```bash
kubectl get pods     
NAME                    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
web1-74c74989b5-2kkbv   1/1     Running   2          120m
web1-74c74989b5-2vhnx   1/1     Running   2          120m
web1-74c74989b5-4l4ss   1/1     Running   2          120m
web1-74c74989b5-8p65q   1/1     Running   2          120m
web1-74c74989b5-9vp8k   1/1     Running   3          120m
web1-74c74989b5-dzqwl   1/1     Running   2          120m
web1-74c74989b5-k7htc   1/1     Running   2          120m
--- 
```
## details about your pods
You can display a great deal of details about your pods with `kubectl describe pod <pod name>`<br>
For example you can see their `namespace`, which `node` they are on, their IP etc.
```bash
kubectl describe pod web1-74c74989b5-2kkbv
Name:         web1-74c74989b5-2kkbv
Namespace:    default
Priority:     0
Node:         minikube/192.168.99.100
```

# deployments
A deployment declares the state of `pods` or `ReplicaSets`.<br>
You describe a desired state in a Deployment, and the Deployment Controller changes the actual state to the desired state at a controlled rate.<br>

## display your deployments
View your deployments with `kubectl get deployments <deployment name>` or `kubectl get deploy` for short and for all deployments.
```bash
kubectl get deploy web1                       
NAME   READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
web1   1/1     1            1           3m17s
```

You can interactively view your deployments with `kubectl get deploy --watch` or `-w` for short.<br>
This will automatically update the output.
```bash
kubectl get deploy --watch                        
NAME   READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
web1   1/1     1            1           3m50s
```

## details about your deployments
You can get a bunch of good details about your deployments with `kubectl describe deployments <deployment name>`
```bash
kubectl describe deployments web1
Name:                   web1
Namespace:              default
CreationTimestamp:      Sun, 16 Feb 2020 12:00:53 +1100
Labels:                 app=web1
Annotations:            deployment.kubernetes.io/revision: 1
Selector:               app=web1
Replicas:               20 desired | 20 updated | 20 total | 20 available | 0 unavailable
StrategyType:           RollingUpdate
```

# services
You can view your exposed services by issuing the command `kubectl get service <service name>`

## View your services
```bash
kubectl get service web1
NAME   TYPE           CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)        AGE
web1   LoadBalancer   10.102.40.76   <pending>     80:30067/TCP   131m
```

## View details of your services
With the `kubectl describe` command you get a new depth of information about your environment.<br>
With this you can see the namespace
```bash
kubectl describe service web1
Name:                     web1
Namespace:                default
Labels:                   app=web1
Annotations:              <none>
Selector:                 app=web1
Type:                     LoadBalancer

```

# ReplicaSet

A ReplicaSetâ€™s purpose is to maintain a stable set of replica Pods running at any given time. As such, it is often used to guarantee the availability of a specified number of identical Pods.<br>
We used this to create 20 web servers as an example with the imperative `kubectl scale deployment --replicas 20 web1`

## view your replicasets
```bash
kubectl get replicasets          
NAME              DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE
web1-74c74989b5   20        20        20      6h24m
```

## view details about your replicasets
```bash
kubectl describe replicasets web1-74c74989b5 
Name:           web1-74c74989b5
Namespace:      default
Selector:       app=web1,pod-template-hash=74c74989b5
Labels:         app=web1
                pod-template-hash=74c74989b5
Annotations:    deployment.kubernetes.io/desired-replicas: 20
```

# namespaces
Namespaces are intended for use in environments with many users spread across multiple teams, or projects.<br>
For clusters with a few to tens of users, you should not need to create or think about namespaces at all.<br>
`default namespace` is where all your pods and services will end up unless otherwise specified.
```bash
kubectl get namespaces       
NAME              STATUS   AGE
default           Active   6h2m
kube-node-lease   Active   6h2m
kube-public       Active   6h2m
kube-system       Active   6h2m
```

To set the namespace for a current request, use the --namespace flag.
```bash
kubectl run nginx --image=nginx --namespace=<insert-namespace-name-here>
kubectl get pods --namespace=<insert-namespace-name-here>
```

You can permanently save the namespace for all subsequent kubectl commands in that context.

```bash
kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=<insert-namespace-name-here>
# Validate it
kubectl config view --minify | grep namespace:
```

### Create a deployment
```bash
# Create a deployment from a demo nginx hello world image
kubectl create deployment --image nginxdemos/hello web1
deployment.apps/web1 created
```

### Scale your deployment
You can scale your deployment by issuing `kubectl scale deployment --replicas <desired number> <deployment name>`<br>
```bash
kubectl scale deployment --replicas 20 web1            
deployment.apps/web1 scaled

# view your new 20 deployments slowly become ready
kubectl get deployments                         
NAME   READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
web1   2/20    20           2           7m48s
```

### expose a deployment to the network
Make ports available by using `kubectl expose deployment <deployment name> --port=<port> --type=<type>` <br>
Adding load onto the load balancer will cause it to distribute the load on to different pods.
```bash
# Simple LoadBalancer example on port 80
kubectl expose deployment web1 --port=80 --type=LoadBalancer
service/web1 exposed
```
There are many types of ways to expose network ports, not only a LoadBalancer.


### Minikube special to connect to your deployment's load-balancer
minikube runs in a virtual machine.<br>
That virtual machine has an internally natted address that we need to extract to be able to connect to our service.<br>
minikube that we run in this course has a command to get the load-balancer URL from your deployment and automatically start your default browser.<br>
This is done with `minikube service <service name>`
```bash
minikube service web1
|-----------|------|-------------|-----------------------------|
| NAMESPACE | NAME | TARGET PORT |             URL             |
|-----------|------|-------------|-----------------------------|
| default   | web1 |             | http://192.168.99.100:30067 |
|-----------|------|-------------|-----------------------------|

# Declarative kubectl
Tell it what you want the end state to look like
Point to manifests (collection of files or a single file)
```bash
kubectl deploy -f <manifest file>
```
## kustomize
When you want to store a secret, you can amend your deployment?
